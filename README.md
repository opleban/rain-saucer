# RainSaucer Calculator

## WHAT IS IT
A simple JS IFrame widget that allows a user to calculate the amount of water they can expect to capture with a Rain Saucer. A user will be able to select the size of the rain saucer and their location based on proximity to a list of major US cities. Initially this data will be drawn from static set of rainfall estimates, however in the future this can be drawn from a public API with up-to-date information and perhaps even allow the user to get information based a larger set of parameters.

## BACKGROUND
RainSaucers[http://wwww.rainsaucers.com] sells a "standalone Rainwater Harvesting System". Currently users are able to use Google excel spreadsheet to estimate the amount of water they can expect to collect on a yearly basis by selecting the size of the saucer and a major US city.

## Tech Stack
TBD
